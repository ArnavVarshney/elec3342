WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net mcdecoder_inst/FSM_sequential_state_reg[0]_0[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin mcdecoder_inst/din_buffer_reg[8]_i_1/O, cell mcdecoder_inst/din_buffer_reg[8]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.

This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
